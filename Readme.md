## Highway Delight Project

### Project Description

This project is a task from Highway Delite internship selection program. As part of the task, I developed a fully functional website incorporating features such as user signup, login, and signup with OTP verification. For the front end, I utilized Vite.js, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript to create a responsive and efficient user interface. On the back end, I employed Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and TypeScript to build a robust server, integrating essential features like email functionality using Nodemailer, authentication with JWT, and password encryption with Bcrypt.js.

Here are the project details:

üîó Client Repository: [Github Link](https://github.com/akash-Sa19/loginsignup-client-hd)

üîó Server Repository: [Github Link](https://github.com/akash-Sa19/loginsignup-server-hd)

üåê Live Website: [visit Here](https://loginsignup-client-hd.vercel.app)

This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement secure, scalable, and user-friendly web applications using modern development frameworks and tools.

**Please note that the first signup attempt may take some time due to the server's cold start on Render.com. I kindly request your patience for a few minutes during this process**

### How to Run project Locally
